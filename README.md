/chee/:
the circulating life force

The energy conservation law states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed - only converted from one form of energy to another. Energy is essential for life. It is a source that we use to provide light and heat, or to power machines. But we also talk about energy as something that can be given or taken, or as a characteristic we assign to ourselves or people in our social circles.

We want to make these energy transactions more visible and tangible. We invite you to experience various energy transformation processes and hope to encourage reflections and awareness toward energy consumption.
What is your current state?


# Tangible Interaction
The Qi installation was made as a part of a 5-week intensive studiocourse called Tangible Interaction which spanned from September to October 2021.
In the course we are meant to explore tangible and interactive design in a physical space, resulting in an exhibition where ifi-students, ifi-staff and friends are invited to experience and interact with the end-exhibitions.


## Notes on the installation
![installation img](https://github.com/Qi/img/installation.jpg)

The installation consists of six interactive parts, three solar-panels, a phone charger, a freezing surface and a warming surface. 
In the heart of the installation we designed a light box which represented the "qi" - an energy source, where different light effects reflected the current energy state when interacted with.
